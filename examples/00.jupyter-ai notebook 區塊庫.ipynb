    "\n",
    "Welcome to the user documentation for Jupyter AI.\n",

    "If you would like to build applications that enhance Jupyter AI,\n",
    "please see the {doc}`developer's guide </developers/index>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Jupyter AI on any system that can run a supported Python version\n",
    "from 3.8 to 3.11, including recent Windows, macOS, and Linux versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use `conda`, you can install Python 3.11 in your environment by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install python=3.11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `jupyter_ai` package, which provides the lab extension and user interface in\n",
    "JupyterLab, depends on JupyterLab 4. If upgrading to JupyterLab 4 is not\n",
    "possible in your environment, you should install `jupyter_ai` v1.x instead.\n",
    "See \"Installation\" for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install JupyterLab using `pip` or `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. via `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# change 4.0 to 3.0 if you need JupyterLab 3\n",
    "pip install jupyterlab~=4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. via `conda`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# change 4.0 to 3.0 if you need JupyterLab 3\n",
    "conda config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "conda config --set channel_priority strict\n",
    "conda install jupyterlab~=4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `jupyter_ai_magics` package, which provides exclusively the IPython magics,\n",
    "does not depend on JupyterLab or `jupyter_ai`. You can install\n",
    "`jupyter_ai_magics` without installing `jupyterlab` or `jupyter_ai`.\n",
    "If you have both `jupyter_ai_magics` and `jupyter_ai` installed, you should\n",
    "have the same version of each, to avoid errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter AI internally uses Pydantic v1 and should work with either Pydantic\n",
    "version 1 or version 2. For compatibility, developers using Pydantic V2\n",
    "should import classes using the `pydantic.v1` package. See the\n",
    "[LangChain Pydantic migration plan](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/pydantic_compatibility)\n",
    "for advice about how developers should use `v1` to avoid mixing v1 and v2\n",

    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation via `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the JupyterLab extension, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install jupyter-ai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest major version of `jupyter-ai`, v2, only supports JupyterLab 4. If you\n",
    "need support for JupyterLab 3, you should install `jupyter-ai` v1 instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install jupyter-ai~=1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not using JupyterLab and you only want to install the Jupyter AI `%%ai` magic, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ pip install jupyter-ai-magics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`jupyter-ai` depends on `jupyter-ai-magics`, so installing `jupyter-ai`\n",
    "automatically installs `jupyter-ai-magics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation via `pip` or `conda` in a Conda environment (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend installing both JupyterLab and Jupyter AI within an isolated\n",
    "Conda environment to avoid clobbering Python packages in your existing Python\n",
    "environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install\n",
    "[conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)\n",
    "and create an environment that uses Python 3.11:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda create -n jupyter-ai python=3.11\n",
    "    $ conda activate jupyter-ai\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, use `conda` to install JupyterLab and Jupyter AI in this Conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-ai  # or,\n",
    "    $ conda install conda-forge::jupyter-ai\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting JupyterLab with Jupyter AI, make sure to activate the Conda\n",
    "environment first:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate jupyter-ai\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uninstallation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed Jupyter AI using `pip`, to remove the extension, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip uninstall jupyter-ai\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip uninstall jupyter-ai-magics\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed Jupyter AI using `conda`, you can remove it by running:\n",

    "this section are based on the [Jupyter AI example notebooks](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai/blob/main/examples/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have `jupyter_ai` installed, the magics package\n",

    "\n",
    "Before you send your first prompt to an AI model, load the IPython extension by\n",
    "running the following code in a notebook cell or IPython shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%load_ext jupyter_ai_magics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command should not produce any output.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "If you are using remote kernels, such as in Amazon SageMaker Studio, the above\n",
    "command will throw an error. You will need to install the magics package\n",
    "on your remote kernel separately, even if you already have `jupyter_ai_magics`\n",
    "installed in your server's environment. In a notebook, run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%pip install jupyter_ai_magics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and re-run `%load_ext jupyter_ai_magics`.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the extension has loaded, you can run `%%ai` cell magic commands and\n",
    "`%ai` line magic commands. Run `%%ai help` or `%ai help` for help with syntax.\n",
    "You can also pass `--help` as an argument to any line magic command (for example,\n",
    "`%ai list --help`) to learn about what the command does and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a provider and model\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%%ai` cell magic allows you to invoke a language model of your choice with\n",
    "a given prompt. The model is identified with a **global model ID**, which is a string with the\n",
    "syntax `<provider-id>:<local-model-id>`, where `<provider-id>` is the ID of the\n",
    "provider and `<local-model-id>` is the ID of the model scoped to that provider.\n",
    "The prompt begins on the second line of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to send a text prompt to the provider `anthropic` and the model ID\n",
    "`claude-v1.2`, enter the following code into a cell and run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai anthropic:claude-v1.2\n",
    "Write a poem about C++.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently support the following language model providers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ai21`\n",
    "- `anthropic`\n",
    "- `anthropic-chat`\n",
    "- `bedrock`\n",
    "- `bedrock-chat`\n",
    "- `cohere`\n",
    "- `huggingface_hub`\n",
    "- `nvidia-chat`\n",
    "- `openai`\n",
    "- `openai-chat`\n",
    "- `sagemaker-endpoint`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing available models\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter AI also includes multiple subcommands, which may be invoked via the\n",
    "`%ai` *line* magic. Jupyter AI uses subcommands to provide additional utilities\n",
    "in notebooks while keeping the same concise syntax for invoking a language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%ai list` subcommand prints a list of available providers and models. Some\n",
    "providers explicitly define a list of supported models in their API. However,\n",
    "other providers, like Hugging Face Hub, lack a well-defined list of available\n",
    "models. In such cases, it's best to consult the provider's upstream\n",
    "documentation. The [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/) includes a\n",
    "list of models, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can specify a provider ID as a positional argument to `%ai list`\n",
    "to get all models provided by one provider. For example, `%ai list openai` will\n",
    "display only models provided by the `openai` provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abbreviated syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model ID is associated with only one provider, you can omit the `provider-id` and\n",
    "the colon from the first line. For example, because `ai21` is the only provider of the\n",
    "`j2-jumbo-instruct` model, you can either give the full provider and model,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai ai21:j2-jumbo-instruct\n",
    "Write some JavaScript code that prints \"hello world\" to the console.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or just the model,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai j2-jumbo-instruct # infers AI21 provider\n",
    "Write some JavaScript code that prints \"hello world\" to the console.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting the output\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Jupyter AI assumes that a model will output markdown, so the output of\n",
    "an `%%ai` command will be formatted as markdown by default. You can override this\n",
    "using the `-f` or `--format` argument to your magic command. Valid formats include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `code`\n",
    "- `image` (for Hugging Face Hub's text-to-image models only)\n",
    "- `markdown`\n",
    "- `math`\n",
    "- `html`\n",
    "- `json`\n",
    "- `text`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to force the output of a command to be interpreted as HTML, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai anthropic:claude-v1.2 -f html\n",
    "Create a square using SVG with a black border and white fill.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell will produce output in IPython's `Math` format, which in a web browser\n",
    "will look like properly typeset equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai chatgpt -f math\n",
    "Generate the 2D heat equation in LaTeX surrounded by `$$`. Do not include an explanation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt will produce output as a code cell below the input cell.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning}\n",
    ":name: run-code\n",
    "**Please review any code that a generative AI model produces before you run it\n",
    "or distribute it.**\n",
    "The code that you get in response to a prompt may have negative side effects and may\n",
    "include calls to nonexistent (hallucinated) APIs.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai chatgpt -f code\n",
    "A function that computes the lowest common multiples of two integers, and\n",
    "a function that runs 5 test cases of the lowest common multiple function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpolating in prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Using curly brace syntax, you can include variables and other Python expressions in your\n",
    "prompt. This lets you execute a prompt using code that the IPython kernel knows about,\n",
    "but that is not in the current cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can set a variable in one notebook cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "poet = \"Walt Whitman\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can use this same variable in an `%%ai` command in a later cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai chatgpt\n",
    "Write a poem in the style of {poet}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When this cell runs, `{poet}` is interpolated as `Walt Whitman`, or as whatever `poet`\n",
    "is assigned to at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the special `In` and `Out` list with interpolation syntax to explain code\n",
    "located elsewhere in a Jupyter notebook. For example, if you run the following code in\n",
    "a cell, and its input is assigned to `In[11]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(0, 5):\n",
    "  print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then refer to `In[11]` in an `%%ai` magic command, and it will be replaced\n",
    "with the code in question:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai cohere:command-xlarge-nightly\n",
    "Please explain the code below:\n",
    "--\n",
    "{In[11]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also refer to the cell's output using the special `Out` list, with the same index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai cohere:command-xlarge-nightly\n",
    "Write code that would produce the following output:\n",
    "--\n",
    "{Out[11]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter AI also adds the special `Err` list, which uses the same indexes as `In` and `Out`.\n",
    "For example, if you run code in `In[3]` that produces an error, that error is captured in\n",
    "`Err[3]` so that you can request an explanation using a prompt such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai chatgpt\n",
    "Explain the following Python error:\n",
    "--\n",
    "{Err[3]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI model that you use will then attempt to explain the error. You could also write a\n",
    "prompt that uses both `In` and `Err` to attempt to get an AI model to correct your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai chatgpt --format code\n",
    "The following Python code:\n",
    "--\n",
    "{In[3]}\n",
    "--\n",
    "produced the following Python error:\n",
    "--\n",
    "{Err[3]}\n",
    "--\n",
    "Write a new version of this code that does not produce that error.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a shortcut for explaining errors, you can use the `%ai error` command, which will explain the most recent error using the model of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%ai error anthropic:claude-v1.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and managing aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an alias for a model using the `%ai register` command. For example, the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%ai register claude anthropic:claude-v1.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will register the alias `claude` as pointing to the `anthropic` provider's `claude-v1.2` model. You can then use this alias as you would use any other model name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%ai claude\n",
    "Write a poem about C++.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define a custom LangChain chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n",
    "from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n",
    "from langchain.llms import OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate(\n",
    "    input_variables=[\"product\"],\n",
    "    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "… and then use `%ai register` to give it a name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%ai register companyname chain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change an alias's target using the `%ai update` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%ai update claude anthropic:claude-instant-v1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can delete an alias using the `%ai delete` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%ai delete claude\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a list of all aliases by running the `%ai list` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aliases' names can contain ASCII letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods. They may not contain colons. They may also not override built-in commands — run `%ai help` for a list of these commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aliases must refer to models or `LLMChain` objects; they cannot refer to other aliases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using magic commands with SageMaker endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use magic commands with models hosted using Amazon SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure that you've set your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables either before starting JupyterLab or using the `%env` magic command within JupyterLab. For more information about environment variables, see [Environment variables to configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) in AWS's documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter AI supports language models hosted on SageMaker endpoints that use JSON schemas. Authenticate with AWS via the `boto3` SDK and have the credentials stored in the `default` profile.  Guidance on how to do this can be found in the [`boto3` documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to deploy a model in SageMaker, then provide it as the model name (as `sagemaker-endpoint:my-model-name`). See the [documentation on how to deploy a JumpStart model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-deploy.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "All SageMaker endpoint requests require you to specify the `--region-name`, `--request-schema`, and `--response-path` options. The example below presumes that you have deployed a model called `jumpstart-dft-hf-text2text-flan-t5-xl`.\n",
    "\n",

    "The `--region-name` parameter is set to the [AWS region code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) where the model is deployed, which in this case is `us-east-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--request-schema` parameter is the JSON object the endpoint expects as input, with the prompt being substituted into any value that matches the string literal `\"<prompt>\"`. For example, the request schema `{\"text_inputs\":\"<prompt>\"}` will submit a JSON object with the prompt stored under the `text_inputs` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--response-path` option is a [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html) string that retrieves the language model's output from the endpoint's JSON response. For example, if your endpoint returns an object with the schema `{\"generated_texts\":[\"<output>\"]}`, its response path is `generated_texts.[0]`.\n",

    "### Configuring default models and API keys\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration allows for setting a default language and embedding models, and their corresponding API keys.\n",
    "These values are offered as a starting point for users, so they don't have to select the models and API keys, however,\n",
